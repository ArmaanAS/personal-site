# Personal Site

This is a work-in-progress personal web app for myself. It uses:

- `Vue.js - Typescript`
- `Vite`
- `TailwindCSS`
- `HeadlessUI`
- `HeroIcons`

## Setup

First install all npm dependencies with

```cmd
npm install
```

## Start

Then you can run the vite server with

```cmd
npm run dev
```
